# Backend Web Dev

## .NET Core Take Home Project

First impressions are important, second impressions are everything. So, it’s time for some
action.

With the following assignment, you can show us what you got. The case tests your
competences regarding development and gives us an idea on how well you come up with
solutions.

## ASSIGNMENT

Create a .NET Core Web API on which you integrate with any third-party services.

- Integrate with a single or multiple third party services and return the data in a simplified
    way. (Movies & Series, News Feeds, Player Game Stats etc.)
- Cache the aggregated data for performance.
- Make sure the search is as smart as it can be.
- Make sure your API is secure and super-fast.
- Optionally create a website using any framework (Angular, React, MVC etc.) that uses
    your Web API to search and show the data your third-party service is returning.
- Use .NET Core to build your Restful API.
- Add some unit tests to improve your projects the code coverage.
- Push your code to Github.

## TIPS

- Follow best practice industry standards and REST guidelines when building your API.
- Make sure your API is well documented (Swagger).

## BONUS

- Surprise us! Add something to your project we haven’t thought of or what you think is a
    valuable addition.

Try to remember and briefly document the decisions you made and why you made them. We
can’t wait to pick your brain.
